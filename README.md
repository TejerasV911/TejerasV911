- 👋 Hi, I’m @TejerasV911
- 👀 I’m interested in ... anything and everything that involves Art, Music, and FPV Drones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to create my own own YouTube channel, creating content that involves my jouney as an FPV Pilot, and the skills required/involved w/ building, creating, and piloting FPV Quadcopters. I also am a drummer (15+ years of experience) and picked up creating Art by using an Airbrush as my tool for painting... I also am learning new video/editing software so I could put together a comprehesive display of my own portfolio. Resulting in a way of providing potential clients with a quick, simple, and direct opportunity to visually see the kind of work I provide and ultimately, display what my capabilities are and how my skills can be utilized for ones individual needs.
